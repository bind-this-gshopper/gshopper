It holds me accountable for making each day notable. When I turn 40, I'll have a 1 hour compilation that encapsulates my 30s. If I live to see 80 years of age, I'll have a 5-hour video that summarizes 50 years of my life.""

No buttons to press. No Watch app to load. Just sleep!

About AutoSleep
-----------------
Using Advanced Heuristics AutoSleep works out how long you've slept so you don't have to.

If you DO wear your Watch to bed, you don't need to do a single thing. AutoSleep will track your sleep & quality and send you a notification in the morning once you unlock your iPhone. 

Even if you don't wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep can track your time in bed. It's extremely simple.

If you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply put your Watch on charge just before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. 

A handy Today Widget lets you see how your own ""batteries"" are charged for last night and the previous seven days. A second (entirely optional) widget lets you also track the time you have taken to fall asleep.

As everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. 

If you wear your Apple Watch to bed*, AutoSleep will also analyse your sleep quality. By using time asleep, restlessness, time awake and heart rate it can score the quality of your sleep and provide you with a comprehensive nightly analysis. 
*Note. If you do not wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep simply captures the amount of time sleeping. 

AutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. 

*Requires Apple Watch running Watch OS 3 or higher."

You can also explore the most beautiful weather animation you’ve ever seen, both forward in time or back. 

(Dark Sky is available in the US, UK and Ireland.)

YOUR WEATHER, DOWN TO THE MINUTE 
Using GPS, Dark Sky is able to create forecasts for your precise location, giving you minute-by-minute predictions for the next hour and hour-by-hour forecasts for the next day and week.

BEAUTIFUL WEATHER ANIMATIONS 
The same technology that powers Dark Sky’s predictions also allows us to make the world’s first perfectly smooth radar animation. Other apps show you a chunky slideshow that makes it nearly impossible to tell how storms are moving. But Dark Sky’s radar animation lets you see the actual path of the storm: how it moved in the past, and where it’s going in the future. 

PUSH NOTIFICATIONS 
Dark Sky comes with advanced notification options: Receive down-to-the-minute alerts before it starts raining at your exact location, get notified of government severe weather alerts (for such things as thunderstorms, flooding, hurricanes, etc), or even create your own custom notifications covering the next 24 hours for things like temperature, wind, precipitation and more. Even if you haven't opened the app in days, Dark Sky will tell you what you need to know, when you need to know it. 

TODAY WIDGET
The Dark Sky Notification Center Widget tells you at a glance what's going to happen in the next hour and the next week, so you don't even have to unlock your phone to quickly check the weather before heading out.

APPLE WATCH
Dark Sky looks great on your wrist. Get notifications and check out the weather for the next week with the Dark Sky app built from scratch for Apple Watch."

NOTE: This game requires at least 512 megs of ram to run properly; low-memory devices such as the iPod gen 3 and 4 will crash during gameplay. If you have a newer device this shouldn't be a problem! 

--------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.

From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!

Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?

""For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games."" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com

Flick your finger and make a homerun.
You can experience a real baseball batting through the physical pendulum. 

This is a game in which you can experience various throws based on the pendulum. The ball will fly further if you can hit the ball directly with the quick flick. Experience a “real-life like” batting simulation. 


■ Easy Control---------------------------
You only use flick to control the batting for this game. The more accurate you flick your finger to hit the ball; it is more likely that you will be a home-run hitter. 
The rule is simple. Flick your finger with the same feeling in which you would swing a bat in real life. Think of your finger as a bat, and flick it with speed and accuracy. That’s all.

■ Movement of the ball------------------
Various kinds of throws are materialized into “real-life like” feelings. Different pitches pull out different various kinds of movements. Thus, the batter may miss the timing and would be hard to hit.

■ 10 GAME mode------------------------
You can enjoy this game through 5 kinds of mode.
Minor & Major Mode- Hit as many home-runs as you can; as far as you can.
Multiplayer Mode- You can compete with other players via Game Center.
Moon-Star Mode- Try for a record with the given 9 balls.
Training Mode- You can practice with different kinds of pitches.
*Bunt mode ( need minor 15step): Drop the ball on the target of the floor correctly.
*Total mode ( need bunt 10000 point ) : You’ll meet many different types of the balls from the beginning of the game.
*Faster & faster ( need total 25000 point ) : Head-to-head with only fastballs.
*Jiant mode ( need F&F 10000 point ) : Match with a Giant pitcher

Do you have activities you like to do with different sets of people? Like playing pick-up basketball, going out to see music, and hunting for Pokemon? 

- With Gather you can create an invite list for anything you like to do and add your friends, or share it on Facebook and your friends who are interested can join on their own. Then next time you want to see who is in all you have is press one button to invite the whole list.

With the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their phone or tablet. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go.

Easy to set up
Teachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.

Saves time

What people are saying:

""Ride-sharing programs like Lyft are providing commuters with less expensive and more social ways to get around. Users log into the app, specify where they’re heading, and a background-checked driver picks them up for less than a typical cab ride."" - TODAY Show

“Lyft is a real community — with both the drivers and riders being inherently social — making real friendships and saving money.” - Time

""In a city where taxis can be scarce and… black town cars are rampant but expensive, Lyft has quickly gained visibility due to low prices and quirky branding."" - Ad Age

""Lyft's focus on the everyman has recently extended to the wildly successful Lyft Line carpool service aimed at commuters, which offers discounts of 30% to 60% for sharing a Lyft ride with others."" - Fast Company

For Lyft drivers, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

Papa's Freezeria To Go!,http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/68/88/cf/6888cf01-4319-fd6c-b58d-4bffd19e4cba/source/175x175bb.jpg,Flipline Studios,$0.99,Games,Version 1.1.2,https://fnd.io/#/us/iphone-app/824305459-papas-freezeria-to-go-by-flipline-studios,"Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!

You've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!

You'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.

Keep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!

** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**

Papa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!

CONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.

BUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.

MIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!

TOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from ""Papa's Burgeria To Go!"" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!

NEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!

**GAME FEATURES**

- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe
- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens
- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping
- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips
- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders
- Challenging Closers and Food Critic

Sense can predict your future events. Just ask any question and Sense will answer it. You will receive answers to questions about your family, relationships, work, money and many other things.

Abilities.
Sense reveals all the sides of personality, using biometric data - the patterns of the palms and fingers. A few minutes are enough to find out details about your character, professional qualities and relationships with your partner. This can be the beginning of the changes within yourself.

Compatibility.
Using the parameters of hands Sense picks up compatible with you people througout the world. When Sense compares the parameters of the hands of two people, there is a comparison and analysis of two sets of psychological characteristics. The more identical or complementary parameters are, the better the two people fit. That this is the main task of Sense - to combine the most appropriate people.

This is a completely new service, which has no analogues in the world. Our team does everything possible to ensure that it is stable and meets the stated requirements. If you notice an incorrect work of Sense or if you have suggestions for improving its performance, please contact us  readhands@gmail.com. We are always glad to hear from you.

Draw your attention to:

1. Processing of photos of the hands and fingers occurs in the phone in real time.
2. Your photos are not sent to the Sense server without your consent.
3. Obtaining the results of the order means downloading them to your iOS device and requires up to 300 MB of free space.

When processing photos of hands, there may be difficulties, which are associated mainly with the incorrect position of the hand in the frame (during shooting, the palm and fingers should be parallel to the iPhone). Sense can not take photos of the palms in any position, as the parameters of the hands will be incorrectly calculated, which will result in inaccurate descriptions of your character. In order to make Sense to correctly determine the parameters of your hands, you must follow the instructions during the shooting. We hope for your understanding of the seriousness of the photographing process. If nevertheless difficulties are not resolved, please contact our support service readhands@gmail.com. We will help you to deal with the problems you have.

We sincerely wish that the app Sense could fill you with optimism, prompt the right way and help you to improve yourself.

Craft, Steal, Brawl and ESCAPE!

You’ve landed yourself in prison again, and your only chance is to engineer an escape by any means necessary. How you do it is up to you! Why not cause a prison riot? Or dig a tunnel right under the walls of the prison? Or even steal a guard uniform to blend in with your captors?

The Escapists is a unique prison sandbox experience with lots of items to craft and combine in your daring quest for freedom. Life in prison will keep you on your toes with the strict rules that you’ll have to break. The guards are out to stop any escape attempts, so you’ll have to avoid suspicious behaviour by attending roll calls, working a prison job and hiding your stolen craftables. 

Escaping is what you do best, and you’ll have to prove your skills in a variety of challenging prisons from across the world, with new prison, Escape team included in the latest update. Locked in a military prison for crimes they did not commit, the 4 members of the Escape team must work out how to break free from an Escape proof military prison. Maybe the rumours that the compound houses the fiercest tank in history will help?

THE BEST APP AROUND THE GLOBE
=============================
•	Awarded Coolest App for Moms
•	Awarded by Apple as top 10 ‘Best of the year 2016’ in Australia, UK, Netherlands, and a great number of other countries.
•	Consumer Choice & Gold Award by MumIi

KEY FEATURES
=============================
Keep track of your baby’s mental development
Learn all about the leaps and bounds and the fussy phases of your baby
Read the bestselling Wonder Weeks book here in this app
Take notes about a range of topics


Think of it as a portable, at-a-glance version of the calendar leap chart in The Wonder Weeks. Where the book describes in-depth and easy-to-understand terms the incredible developmental changes your baby goes through, the app is the perfect leap calendar companion to track your baby’s mental development (during the first 20 months). By knowing what is going on inside the head of your baby, you can help him to make the leap more easily and stimulate his development. 

The Wonder Weeks app helps new parents by:   
- Calendar Showing when your baby makes a leap in his mental development 
- What your baby can understand & learn after this mental leap  
- What your baby can do after this leap  
- What you can do to help your baby   

This app is also a handy reminder for new parents when their baby’s brain is changing, or “leaping,” the baby is making a significant advance in mental development, and with each step forward comes a drastic change in the way your baby sees the world around him. Because these leaps come so quickly, the “new world” and new abilities can sometimes be scary, and the development can initially manifest in poor sleep, bad appetite, crying, clinging and crankiness – exhausting and frustrating mom and dad. 

International experts on The Wonder Weeks:  “This is a very practical and entertaining window into the baby’s first year and a half. van de Rijt and Plooij have observed and found the vulnerable times in an infant’s development that I independently came to in my book Touchpoints (Perseus Books Group). The authors’ observations and practical suggestions are wonderful.”  -T. Berry Brazelton, M.D., professor emeritus, Harvard Medical School   

""Anyone who deals with infants and young children will want to read The Wonder Weeks. This book will open parents' eyes to aspects of their children's growth, development, changing behavior, and emotional responsiveness that they might otherwise not notice or find puzzling and distressing.""  -Catherine Snow, Ph.D., Shattuck Professor of Education, Harvard Graduate School of Education

It’s much more than just a tuner!
      
So what makes the TonalEnergy the best selling music practice app?
 
• It's an all-in-one app, with a state-of-the-art tuner, an advanced metronome, dedicated orchestral strings and guitar tuning page, a piano keyboard, sound analysis pages, and audio/visual recording capabilities.

• It’s easy to use. Options like the Target Tuner or Pitch Tracker are on all the main pages.  TonalEnergy helps users create rewarding and attainable goals during a rehearsal or when working alone. Colorful analysis data pages and audio/video recording features enhance the experience of practice.  

• The metronome is cutting edge. It offers unmatched flexibility in sound choices, tempo settings, meters, subdivision patterns and visual displays. Voice count-ins, the ability to create and edit preset groups and Ableton link for syncing multiple devices make this a superior tool for performers. 

• Ear training possibilities are endless. The high quality multi-sampled instrument sounds for symphonic instruments are unique among all other tuning applications. Listening skills can be developed through the use of the eight-octave keyboard, chromatic wheel and tone generator. There are no other sounds like these. 

• Learning is a social activity. Using features unique to the TonalEnergy Tuner, data can be collected, reviewed, edited and shared with others. Feedback is essential for growing and developing great performers. It’s all about connectivity.

Chris Coletti, member of The Canadian Brass, sums up TonalEnergy by saying,

      “TonalEnergy is a must-have for any serious musician. It's a full suite of tools in one app; the tuner, tone generator, recorder, metronome and beautiful interface make it one of the best tools for musicians out there, period.” 

FEATURES

• Recognizes a large pitch range, extending to lower registers than many competing tuners (C0 - C8) that is highly responsive to wind instruments, as well as acoustic and electric string instruments
• Adjustable A=440 Hz reference 
• Automatic or manual transposing options
• Instantly changes between equal, just and other custom temperaments, including user-defined ones
• Auto or instant pitch reference note feature using the TonalEnergy sounds

• MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, and Voice Messages.

• GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group chats with your contacts so you can easily stay in touch with your friends or family.

• ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you're always logged in so you don't miss messages. No more confusion about whether you're logged in or logged out. 

• QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there's no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.
